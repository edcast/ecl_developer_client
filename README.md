# EclDeveeloperClient

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/ecl_developer_client`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
#tryout in irb
  gem install specific_install
  gem specific_install -l https://d7f5b0a7f74cadd93799ae93eb277453414f1e14:x-oauth-basic@github.com/Course-Master/ecl_developer_client.git

# In Bundle
gem 'ecl_developer_client', :git => 'https://d7f5b0a7f74cadd93799ae93eb277453414f1e14:x-oauth-basic@github.com/Course-Master/ecl_developer_client.git'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ecl_developer_client

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
